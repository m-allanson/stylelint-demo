## About

It consists of two parts:

- A web server that accepts `code` and `config` parameters, passes them to stylelint and then responds with stylelint's output.
- A frontend for creating `code` and `config` blocks, and rendering server responses.

## Deployment

Commits to `master` will be tested by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-demo/actions). Successful builds will automatically be deployed to [https://stylelint-demo.herokuapp.com/](https://stylelint-demo.herokuapp.com/).
